## Description

The goal of this project is to extend the project from Smith et al. by fixing some critical errors and bottlenecks, and introducing multithreading for the processing of multiple SfP scenes. Also, the new code produces .mat files including the surface normal vectors reconstructed by each method, allowing comparisons through external tools.
